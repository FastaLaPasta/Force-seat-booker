# 🎬 UGC Force Seat Bot 👾

> "This is the seat you're looking for."

## 💡 The Origin Story

It all started with a galactic *catastrophe*…  
A long time ago (well, like last week) in a cinema not so far away, I just **wanted to watch Star Wars**. But alas… every single seat was booked. The Dark Side had won.

Until I had a **brilliant, mischievous** idea:  
> What if I could build a bot that automatically checks for a **desisting Jedi**—someone who canceled their reservation—and **snatch the seat** the moment it becomes available?

Thus, the **UGC Force Seat Bot** was born.  
A bot with one mission: _bring balance to the seat reservations._

## ✅ What’s Done So Far

- 🔎 Automatically navigates the UGC booking site
- 🗓 Parses available screening dates
- 🍿 Lets you choose your city, cinema, and movie
- 🤖 Selects the desired date even if it's off-screen (with scroll magic)
- 🧪 Debugging tools and logs for testing the seat-checking logic

You can already see it visiting the site like a regular moviegoer... except it doesn’t eat popcorn.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

The bot is still training in the ways of the Force. Here's what's being actively worked on:

- 🪑 Detecting available seats dynamically
- 📬 Notifying the user (via email, Telegram, etc.) when a seat becomes available
- 🕵️‍♂️ Smarter detection of movie times and filtering for desired hours
- ⏳ Scheduling automatic checks every X minutes

## 🔮 Coming Soon

- 🎟 Auto-booking functionality (only if ethically justifiable 😉)
- 🧠 Smarter AI that learns your preferences
- 🧘‍♂️ UI/UX Zen mode for non-tech users
- 🛰 Deployable on a Raspberry Pi to run 24/7 like a true Sith Lord
